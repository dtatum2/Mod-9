CSharp Questions Challenge
1.  Q: What is a namespace?
    A: A namespace keeps a set of names from next to another.
2.  Q: What are value types?
    A: They store data and can be directly assigned to a value. Include int, char, and float.
3.  Q: What are reference types?
    A: They contain a reference to variables and are a memory loaction. include object, dyanmic, and string.
4.  Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
    A: Make declaring properties more precise and whne no additional is used.
5.  Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
    A: Includes the namespaces in a program.
6.  Q: What are dynamic type variables?
    A: They store any type of value.
7.  Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
    A: It checks if a object works with a type or not.
8.  Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
    A: They allow you to write a class or method with different data types. They enrich your program and maximize code use.
9.  Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
    A: a function that has definition similiar to any other variable in class.
10. Q: Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
    A: yes
11. Q: How do you sort an array?
    A: Use array assort.
12. Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
    A: Nullable types can be assigned normal values and null values. You use these when you need to define a unknown value of a type.
13. Q: What is an enumeration?
    A: A set of integer named constants. Defined by enum keyword.
14. Q: What is inheritance?
    A: Inheritance allows you to define a class within a class.
15. Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
    A: No it isn't supported in C.
16. Q: What is the purpose of as operator?
    A: A operator tells compiler which function to perform.
17. Q: What is an object?
    A: A object is a instance of a class created through dynamics.
18. Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
    A:  An interface is an abstract base class. Any class that uses interfaces has to use all of its components. 
19. Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
    A: A break causes a loop to be exited immediately and a continue cause a iteration.
20. Q: What is this and how is it used?
    A: U delcalre them after a block of code.
21. Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
    A: Try identies a block of code with exceptions. Catch is the catching of the exception. 
22. Q: How is exception handling done?
    A: the process of responding to exceptions changing the normal flow of the program.
23. Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
    A: It is a function used to execute a given set of statements.
24. Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
    A: Arrays store a specific amount of elements that are the same type and have to be defined first. In an array list, the number of elements can be changed anytime and different types of elements can be stored. You would use an array if you were dealing with one type of element. An array list would be used because it is quicker and when multiple variables would be involved.
26. Q: Define constructor.
    A: Function created whenever new objects of class are created.
27. Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
    A: All the time.
28. Q: What is an abstract class?
    A: An abstract class has many abstract methods, abstract methods contain no implementation.
29. Q: What is an interface?
    A: An interface is an abstract base class. Any class that uses interfaces has to use all of its components.
30. Q: What is a method?
    A: a group of statements that work together to perform a task.
31. Q: What is a property?
    A: Properties are named members of classes, structures, and interfaces.
32. Q: What is an access specifier?
    A: A keyword that sets accessibility.
33. Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
    A: Private, public, protected, internal are accesss specifiers.
34. Q: What is a collection?
    A: Classes for storage and retrieval.
35. Q: What is a Hash Table?
    A: Uses a key to access elements in a collection.
